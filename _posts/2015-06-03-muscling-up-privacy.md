## Do less make more, do more make less

Software is a thing that always conflict but effective as it is. When it comes to privacy tools, it seems like a encumbrance on most softwares. If you are using [OpenPGP](http://www.openpgp.org/) based tool to manage you sensitive data, you will always struggling about it's antihuman-like apis. You will even have to understand the keystructure, symmetric/asymmetric cryptography and even the whole protocol, so that you can get the idea of "Now, I'm really safe."

It's quite urgent issue of the time being. So STRIKE team is mainly up to bring better experience to these tools now.

### Privacy does not equal to Security

### Is browser safe enough to do cryptography?

### Don't treat privacy as an easy-hard issue
