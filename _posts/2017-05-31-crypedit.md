## Consistency over the decentrialized network

CAP triangle have told us the Distributed system will always struggle with the balance of Consistency, Availability and Partition tolerance, as far as we go, the consistency is becoming more vague over the decentrialized network, we can see, Bitcoin has a proposal of lighting network and Aeternity recently raised State Channel to avoid this problem. 

## Can we have Partition Tolerance?

When the first time I asked myself, why we have to make the Consistency first class, actually we can have Partition Tolerance. To achieve this, we need a primitive system based on Fuzzy math, in classic Cryptography systems, accuracy plus entropy make them work, but while we start to work in reality, accuracy sometimes leads to overfits, that's why in machine learning researchers introduce dropouts or early stopping. I'm recently reading the paper about FuzzySets, L.A.Zadeh establish this theory in 1965.
