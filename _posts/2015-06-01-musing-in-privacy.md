## Why you should care about privacy

While we are making descion to contribute to privacy tools like Enigmail/GnuPG, the idea comes from our enthusiasts but not from common people, who are possiblly ignoring their privacy safety, or even their privacy's value.

Ask yourself the reason for privacy caring. I'm coming up with several items which may fits to most people.

- I'm doing secret things, which don't want you know
- I'm sending out messages to someone, which don't want others spy
- You are trusting me as who I am, which don't want others to pretend

And ask yourself the reason for making a thing pulic, then you can find something conflict.

- I'm doing public things, which don't want you know who did it
- I'm sending out messages to someone, which also want others authorized to read if necessary
- You are trusting me as who I am, which can be delegated by my trusted agencies.
