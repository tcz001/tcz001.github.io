## Why you should care about privacy

While we are making descion to contribute to privacy tools like Enigmail/GnuPG, the idea comes from our enthusiasts but not from common people, who are possiblly ignoring their privacy safety, or even their privacy's value.

Ask yourself the reason for privacy caring. I'm coming up with several items which may fits to most people.

- I'm doing secret things, which I don't want you know.
- I'm sending out messages to someone, which I don't want others spy.
- You are trusting me as who I am, which I don't want others to pretend.

And ask yourself the reason for making a thing pulic, then you can find something conflict.

- I'm doing public things, which don't want you know who did it.
- I'm sending out messages to someone, which also want others authorized to read if necessary.
- You are trusting me as who I am, which can be delegated by my trusted agencies.

There is extra ideas you may not come up with, don't be selfish.

- I'm not alone, so the value of privacy to us isn't primarily about our privacy but about those who play a more active role in the operation of a democratic system of government.
- If you can bring a better world which I prefer, I don't care whether you're tracing my privacy or protecting it. But don't make me feel uncomfortable before enjoying the compensation.

## What's the current situation about privacy

You are traced in a bunch of levels, some you may find, some you may not realize.
For people in China, when it comes to our proud GFW things are really apparent, everyone on the internet may know it's existance, people are blocked from several websites in a black list, and the primary circuit router will always tracing several sensitive words.
