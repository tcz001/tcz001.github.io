## Consistency over the decentrialized network

CAP triangle have told us the Distributed system will always struggle with the balance of Consistency, Availability and Partition tolerance, as far as we go, the consistency is becoming more vague over the decentrialized network, we can see, Bitcoin has a proposal of lighting network and Aeternity recently raised State Channel to avoid this problem. 

## Can we have Partition Tolerance?

When the first time I asked myself, why we have to make the Consistency first class, actually we can have Partition Tolerance. To achieve this, we need a primitive system based on Fuzzy math, in classic Cryptography systems, accuracy plus entropy make them work, but while we start to work in reality, accuracy sometimes leads to overfits, that's why in machine learning researchers introduce dropouts or early stopping. I'm recently reading the paper about FuzzySets, L.A.Zadeh establish this theory in 1965, which inspired me a lot.

## Crypedit - A proposal of coinless transactions

This type of transaction probably already existed before, I'm trying to dump some ideas that can remove the concept of coins, but this doesn't mean we don't need coin as a value object, there will still be a unit for counting, the most critical part in a society, credits.

Most of the transaction without real product is related with a treasured "thing" that can share confidence between different people, but once it comes to people that most "shared value" are just investment that has high potential possibility to get back the same as(or more than) they cost before.

"More or less stable" - that's the critical part of what people need when a type of goods changing into currency. Let's look back at our lovely gold and bitcoin, they both have such kind of feature. So in my proposal, we hope the value can be kept in your credit instead of untrackable coins, though we think privacy is an important feature, we still can separate this from transactions without any further infomation or side-effects.
